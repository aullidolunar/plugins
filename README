* Updated for unicode version and new nsis 3.x series api
* Note that some functions where removed.
* Also note that in some functions the parameters changed too.

* Need support? Go here: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=382177

To build the plugin, you need:
* cmake >= 3.0
* nsis (NSIS must be registered in your environment variables pointing to your ${NSISDIR})
* msvc 2005+
* platform sdk
* Could work with gcc >= 4.7 (still testing)

to build:
* Create a "build" directory in source dir.
* chang directory to "build"
* run: cmake [-G "MinGW Makefiles"] [-DUSE_UNICODE=OFF] ..
