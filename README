Dialogs plugin for nsis
* This is updated from my old one (see here: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=171833)
* Updated for unicode version
* Note that some functions where removed.
* Also note that in some functions the parameters changed too.
* See examples

To build the plugin, you need:
* cmake >= 3.0
* nsis (NSIS must be registered in your environment variables pointing to $NSISDIR)
* msvc 2005+
* platform sdk
* Could work with gcc >= 4.7 (still testing)
